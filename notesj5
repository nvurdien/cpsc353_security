security isn't binary, on a spectrum
    more or less secure (against what?)

security is a process, not a product

methods of auth:
tumbler -- something you have
combo -- something you know

can be combined to a two-factor auth
i.e bankpin and card

q. how to open a lock (unauthorized)?
    1. guess creds -- brute force
        lockpick
    2. steal creds
    3. overwhelm the system
    4. destroy the mechanism
    5. side channel


reference vector

auth? compare

new features w/ reference
feature is almost equivalent to reference
